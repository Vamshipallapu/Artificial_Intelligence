        "In Azure, a \"handle\" typically refers to an object that represents a reference to a resource or entity within the Azure ecosystem. It's not a specific term used officially by Azure, but it could be interpreted as such in the context of managing Azure resources programmatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you're working with Azure resources programmatically, such as through Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or Azure SDKs, you often need to refer to specific resources like virtual machines, storage accounts, databases, etc. Handles, in this context, can be thought of as identifiers or references to those resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, when you create a virtual machine in Azure, you might receive a handle (usually in the form of a unique identifier or resource URI) that represents that virtual machine. You can then use this handle to perform various operations on the virtual machine, such as starting, stopping, or deleting it.\n",
