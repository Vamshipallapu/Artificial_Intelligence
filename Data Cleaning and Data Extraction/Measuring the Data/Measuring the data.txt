The Things which we need to check once we get the data into our hand
=====================================================================

How are the rows of the dataset uniquely identified? (What is the unit of analysis?)

How many rows and columns are in the dataset?

What are the key categorical variables and the frequencies of each value?

How are important continuous variables distributed?

How might variables be related to each other â€“ for example, 
how might the distribution of continuous variables vary according to categories in the data?


What variable values are out of expected ranges, and how are missing values
distributed?
