importing data from web pages:
===============================

Beautiful Soup in this recipe to scrape data from a web page and load
that data into pandas. 

Web scraping is very useful when there is data at a website that is updated regularly but there is no API

web scrapers we build can be broken when the structure of the targeted page changes. That is less likely to happen with APIs because they are
designed for data exchange, and carefully curated with that end in mind.

scraping presents data cleaning issues that are familiar, such as changing data types in columns, less than ideal headings, and
missing values.
