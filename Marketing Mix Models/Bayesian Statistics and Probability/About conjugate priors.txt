Sure, let's consider an example to illustrate the concept of conjugate priors and how they result in a posterior distribution with the same functional form as the prior distribution 
but with updated parameters.

Suppose we have a scenario where we want to estimate the probability of success (θ) in a Bernoulli trial, 
such as flipping a coin. The Bernoulli distribution models the probability of success in a single trial with two possible outcomes: success (1) or failure (0).

The likelihood function for a single Bernoulli trial with a success (x = 1) is:
L(θ | x = 1) = θ

And the likelihood function for a failure (x = 0) is:
L(θ | x = 0) = 1 - θ

Now, let's assume that we have a prior belief about the probability of success θ, 
and we choose to use the Beta distribution as our prior. The Beta distribution is a conjugate prior for the Bernoulli likelihood function.

The probability density function (PDF) of the Beta distribution is:
π(θ | α, β) = Γ(α + β) / (Γ(α) Γ(β)) * θ^(α - 1) * (1 - θ)^(β - 1)

Here, α and β are the shape parameters of the Beta distribution, and Γ is the gamma function.

Let's say we start with a prior belief that α = 2 and β = 3, which represents a prior distribution that is skewed towards lower values of θ (since α < β).

Now, we observe some data from the Bernoulli trials. Suppose we observe 3 successes and 2 failures. The likelihood function for this data is:
L(θ | data) = θ^3 * (1 - θ)^2

To obtain the posterior distribution, we multiply the prior distribution π(θ | α, β) by the likelihood function L(θ | data) and 
normalize it to get a valid probability distribution.

The resulting posterior distribution is:
π(θ | data) ∝ π(θ | α, β) * L(θ | data)
π(θ | data) ∝ θ^(α - 1) * (1 - θ)^(β - 1) * θ^3 * (1 - θ)^2
π(θ | data) ∝ θ^(α + 3 - 1) * (1 - θ)^(β + 2 - 1)
π(θ | data) ∝ θ^(α + 3 - 1) * (1 - θ)^(β + 2 - 1)

This resulting posterior distribution has the same functional form as the Beta distribution, but with updated parameters α' = α + 3 = 5 and β' = β + 2 = 5.
So, the posterior distribution π(θ | data) is a Beta distribution with parameters α' = 5 and β' = 5, which incorporates both the prior belief and the observed data.
In this example, you can see that by using the conjugate prior (Beta distribution) for the Bernoulli likelihood, 
the posterior distribution has the same functional form (Beta distribution) as the prior, but with updated parameters α' and β' that reflect the observed data.
This property of conjugate priors simplifies the calculation of the posterior distribution and allows for an analytical solution, 
rather than requiring numerical approximation methods.
