For two discrete random variables, X and Y, the JPMF is denoted as P(X = x, Y = y), and it represents the probability that X takes the value x and Y takes the value y simultaneously.\n",

        "Suppose we want to study the relationship between a person's height and weight. Let X be the random variable representing height (in meters), and Y be the random variable representing weight (in kilograms). The joint distribution of X and Y can be described using either the JPMF (if we discretize height and weight) or the JPDF (if we treat them as continuous variables).\n",

        "Joint distributions are essential for understanding the dependence structure between random variables and making inferences about their relationships. They are widely used in fields like economics, finance, engineering, and social sciences, where analyzing the simultaneous behavior of multiple variables is crucial."
