What is a stochastic process?


A stochastic process is a mathematical model used to describe the evolution of a system over time in a probabilistic manner. 
Unlike deterministic processes, where the outcome is completely determined by the initial conditions, 
stochastic processes involve randomness or uncertainty in their evolution.

In a stochastic process, the future behavior of the system is not entirely predictable, even if the current state is known.
